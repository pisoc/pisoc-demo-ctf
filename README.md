# Challenges 

## 01: Bruteforece

Students are given two files:

- An sqlite database containing a username ('admin') and hashed password
- Partial code for cracking a hashed password

Their task is to complete the bruteforce code and recover the password. 

The same password can then be used to unzip a password-protected zip file, giving them access to the next challenge.

## 02: Symmetric encryption 

Students are given a ciphertext and a simple encryption algorithm. 

They're required to write a decryption algorithm by looking through the encryption code and "reversing" it.

The decrypted cleartext points them to a web application.

## 03: 

captured pw db

bruteforce their password

use that to decrypt a zip



- Bruteforce a bad password
- Encrypted zip file
- Encrypt/decryption algorithm
